# Basic Python Programming

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy words. 

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all or very little programming experience. 

You can use Python 3.6 or any newer Python with this tutorial. Don't use Python 2 because it's no longer supported.
